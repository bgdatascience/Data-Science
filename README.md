# BG Data-Science
Welcome to my repository!

I am a professional data processor and survey scripter who has worked in market research for more than 4 years and developed a strong interest for data science in the process.

I have a lot of experience with scripting online-surveys in Decipher, pre-processing panel data with SPSS and producing analysis-ready data files in different formats such as BI-dashboard compatible .csv files, dynamic recurring brand trackers, and customized ad-hoc deliveries.

Within the past 2 years, I have taken online courses to develop myself and gain the latest knowledge in the field of data science. This repository is the place where I will frequently upload new projects to document my progress, thoughts and working style.

My latest projects include a detailed linear regression to predict the prices of second-hand cars as well as a detailed logistic regression examining income based on demographic factors. Both projects include data pre-processing as well.

More projects wills come in the future. Feel free to have a look and comment! I am always willing to develop myself further. :)

Have a great day!

Bennet
