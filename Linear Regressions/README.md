# Multiple Linear Regression on Car Data
Key Words: <b>Python, Pre-Processing, Multiple Linear Regression, Price Prediction</b>

This example tackles a <em>multiple linear regression</em> on car data. The dataset contains corss-sectional data for <em>second-hand cars</em> offered by different car dealerships. Given a number of both numeric and categorical features, a linear model will be used to predict the car price. The raw data will be <em>pre-processed</em>, the model will be fit to training data, tested on a test dataset, and <em>price-predictions</em> will be made for 3 fictional cars. The process is described in detail in the notebook.

The dataset is public and available in this repository.

The environment used for this example is <b>Jupyter Notebook</b>.

The packages used in this example are: <b>numpy, pandas, matplotlib, statsmodels, sklearn</b> and <b>seaborn</b>
