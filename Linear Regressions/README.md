# Linear Regression Car Data
Key Words: <b>Python, Data Pre-processing, Linear Regression, Price Prediction</b>

This example tackles a <em>linear regression</em> on car data. The dataset contains data points for <em>second-hand cars</em> offered by a number of car dealerships. Given a number of both numeric and categorical features, a linear model will be used to predict the car price. The raw data will be <em>pre-processed</em>, the model will be fit to training data, tested on a test dataset, and <em>price-predictions</em> will be made for 3 fictional cars.

The dataset is public and available in this repository. The descriptions in this example are very detailed.

The packages used in this example are:

<b>numpy, pandas, matplotlib, statmodels, sklearn, seaborn</b>
