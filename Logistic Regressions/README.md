Key Words: <b>Python, Logistic Regression, Pre-processing, Predicting Income via Demographics</b>

This example tackles a <em>logistic regression</em> on the "Adult" dataset. The dataset contains data points for adult <em>indviduals</em>. Given a number of categorical, demographic features, a logistic model will be used to predict whether or not an individual is likely to have a yearly household income of more than 50.000 dollars. The data will be <em>pre-processed</em>, the model will be fit to training data, tested on a test dataset, and <em>income predictions</em> will be made for 4 fictional persons with different demographic backgrounds.

The dataset is public and available in this repository. The descriptions in this example are very detailed.

The packages used in this example are:

<b>numpy, pandas, matplotlib, statmodels, sklearn, seaborn</b>
