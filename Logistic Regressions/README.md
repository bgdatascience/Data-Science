# Logistic Regression on "Adult" Dataset (Income > 50.000 Dollars)
Key Words: <b>Python, Logistic Regression, Pre-Processing, Predicting Income via Demographics</b>

This example tackles a <em>logistic regression</em> on the "Adult" dataset. The dataset contains cross-sectional data for adult <em>indviduals</em>. Given a number of categorical, demographic features, a logistic model will be used to predict whether or not an individual is likely to have a yearly household income of more than 50.000 dollars. The data will be <em>pre-processed</em>, the model will be fit to training data, tested on a test dataset, and <em>income predictions</em> will be made for 4 fictional persons with different demographic backgrounds. The process is described in detail in the notebook.

The dataset is public and available in this repository.

The environment used for this example is <b>Jupyter Notebook</b>

The packages used in this example are: <b>numpy, pandas, matplotlib, statmodels, sklearn</b> and <b>seaborn</b>
