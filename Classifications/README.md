# Classifications
Welcome to the Classifications folder!

In this folder, you will find examples that tackle problems which require <em>binary solutions</em> (yes or no, one or zero).

Several Python packages and methods are used to create algorithms that aim to predict as accurately as possible the binary outcome of a dependent variable based on related input variables. Where possible, predictions are made with these models and an accuracy will be determined.

All examples include pre-processing, including the extraction of information from string variables, categorizations, dealing with missing values, standardization and more.

Please feel free to pick the example you are interested in and dive into the cases and commented notebooks! :)

Enjoy!
