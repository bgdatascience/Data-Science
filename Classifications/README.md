# Classifications
Welcome to the Classifications folder!

In this folder, you will find examples that tackle problems which require <em>binary solutions</em> (yes or no, one or zero).

Several Python packages and methods are used to create algorithms that aim to predict as accurately as possible the binary outcome of a dependent variable based on related input variables. Where possible, predictions are made with these models and an accuracy will be determined.

All examples include pre-processing, including the <em>extraction of information from string variables, categorization, dealing with missing values, standardization</em> and more.

Please feel free to pick the example(s) you are interested in and dive into the cases and commented notebooks! :)

Enjoy!
