# Predicting Survivors of the Titanic Shipwreck
Keywords: <b>Python, Pre-Processing, Classification, Titanic Shipwreck, Pedicting Survivors</b>

This example is based on a competition on <em>Kaggle.com/c/titanic"</em>. The task is to use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

The data consists of a train and test dataset. The train dataset has information on whether or not a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck. The test data does not have this information and thus needs to be predicted by a model trained on the train dataset. The data will be <em>pre-processed, information will be won from string variables and transformed into numeric form, variables will be categorized and standardized</em>. Several classifiers such as <em>logisitc regression, naive bayes, support vector machines and more</em> will be used to solve the problem.

The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle under the given link.

The environment used for this example is <b>Jupyter Notebook</b>

The packages used in this example are: <b>pandas, pandas_profiling, numpy, scipy, fancyimpute, sklearn, statsmodels, xgboost</b> and <b>matplotlib</b>

The submitted result from this example classified <b>78%</b> of the survivors in the test dataset correctly.
