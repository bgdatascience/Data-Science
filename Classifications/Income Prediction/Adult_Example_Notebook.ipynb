Secondly, United States citizens are heavily overrepresented in the data, in fact so much so, that even if we decided to only create two categories (US Citizen vs. Not US Citizen), our minority category would only make up ca. 10% of the sample. Moreover, summarizing the multitude of other countries in the dataset under just one category called \"Other Countries\" would not at all reflect the differences between them, e.g. from a cultural perspective.

    "We can see that every variable apart from <b>sex</b> and <b>income</b> has at least 5 distinct categories. Moreover, while checking for missing values we could see that some categories could be combined in order to make their respective variables easier to work with. For instance, if we were to create a dummy variable for each education level, we would fill our dataset with 15 (16 minus the reference category) dummies for education alone. At the same time, persons with a degree after 10, 11 or 12 years of school would probably not differ so much from each other as to justify an own dummy for each of them. Instead, we can create categories such as \"with higher education\" and \"without higher education\", thereby reducing our need for dummies to only 1 (with values 0 or 1) and making <b>education</b> much easier to handle and look at.\n",

We then receive <em>R² values</em> for each regression, which indicate how well each variable can be explained by others. VIF values of 10 or higher have been described as indicating a problematic amount of collinearity, which should be corrected, possibly by dropping the respective variable from the model."

    "We can see that the \"membership\" in a specific <b>age group</b> is by far the most defining indicator for an individuals income. As expected, the older and individual, the higher the chances that her/his income would be high. This reflects the effect of seniority in the job with more years on the job market resulting in more senior positions and a higher pay check. The biggest difference can be observed between the reference group (17-24) and the 45-54 year olds. It seems that income peaks in this age group and falls off afterwards, with most persons aged 65+ probably being retired already and thus earning a lower income (however still being almost 8 times more likely to earn more than 50.000 dollars a year comared to the youngsters).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we can see that <b>status</b> also has a big impact, meaning that indviduals in active partnerships are about 8 times as likely to earn more than 50.000 dollars a year than those being \"alone\". This might be due to the fact that the income measured here is the household income and that two persons can contribute more to it than a single person. However, since <b>status</b> in this dataset was only measured by \"being married\", chances for someone actually being married also increase with age. Therefore, the gaping difference in income between the youngest and the older age groups is probably amplyfied by the fact that there are more married individuals in the older ages. A further indicator for this is that the differences of the odds between the older age groups are not as big with exception of the oldest age group, where retirement plays a role.\n",
    "\n",
    "As one would expect, individuals with a higher <b>education</b> are almost three times as likely to have a higher income compared to those without. However, the effect between the compared groups is not as pronounced compared with age. However, many persons in the youngest age group might not yet have had the chance to reach their highest possible education. Therefore, education is likely another confounding factor that emphasizes the differences in income with regard to age.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can observe a similar impact of <b>occupation</b> on a persons income, signalling that \"white collar\" workers are almost 3 times as likely as \"blue collar\" workers to have a high income. This is due to the fact that white collar jobs are associated with skilled labour, which is usually rewarded with a higher salary, whereas blue collar positions comprise unskilled labour with lower salaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was also to expect that men are more likely to have a high yearly income than women, which is caused by the pay gap between the <b>genders</b> that still exists in most countries today (and this dataset it from the 1970s). Men are almost twice as likely to earn more than 50.000 dollars a year than women. However, the effect is not as pronounced as it is for many other variables that we tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a discrepancy between <b>white and non-white</b> individuals. Being white appears to offer an almost 40% higher chance to receive a high yearly income. Since most of the individuals in the data are from North America, this result mostly reflects the situation there but might be similar in other western countries at least.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, there is a roughly 11% lower chance to earn more than 50.000 dollars are year for those who work for <b>private companies compared to persons in public positions</b>. Even though the effect is not very big, it might be plausible considering that public institutions mostly offer better working conditions and boni to their workers. Also, seniority is rewarded more linearly in the public sector. Private companies can freely decide which salaries they want to pay and how they want to reward seniority, whereas there are fixed rules for this in public jobs. Moreover, private companies are profit oriented and might apply practices such as employing cheap labour (and dumping) to save money. It can be argued that private companies also have the potential to pay significantly higher salaries than public institutions ever would, but in the broad perspective, there are probably more companies that pay out lower rather than higher salaries compared to what public servants earn.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Conclusion</b>: Married, white men aged 45-54, with a higher education and a white collar job within the public sector have the best chance to have an income above 50.000 dollars yearly, whereas single, non-white women between 17-24, without a higher education and a blue collar job in the private sector have the lowest chances of earning more than 50.000 dollars a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "None of these results appears to be particularly surprising."
